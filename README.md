---

## Stripe Setup

To integrate Stripe payments into your Django project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Stripe Account**: Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) if you haven't already.

2. **Obtain API Keys**: From your Stripe dashboard, navigate to the Developers > API keys section to find your Publishable Key and Secret Key.

3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Store your API keys and webhook secret (`STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WH_SECRET`) in environment variables for security. This can be done in a `.env` file or directly in your environment's configuration, depending on your setup.

4. **Update `settings.py`**: Ensure your project's `settings.py` includes these environment variables as shown below:

   ```python
   STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')
   STRIPE_WH_SECRET = os.getenv('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')

---

## Integrating Stripe Webhooks

Stripe webhooks are essential for real-time notifications about Stripe events. This project includes a robust implementation for handling Stripe webhook events, ensuring that actions like successful payments, failed payments, and other significant events are processed accordingly.

### Overview

The webhook implementation consists of two main components:

- **Webhook Handler (`webhook_handler.py`)**: A class responsible for defining specific actions based on different types of webhook events received from Stripe. It includes methods for handling events such as `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`, and any unhandled events.

- **Webhook Receiver (`webhooks.py`)**: A Django view that listens for incoming webhook events from Stripe, verifies their authenticity, and dispatches them to the appropriate handler methods defined in the `StripeWH_Handler` class.

### Setup Instructions

To set up Stripe webhooks for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Stripe API Keys**: Ensure you have set the `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` in your environment variables. These are crucial for interacting with the Stripe API and verifying webhook signatures.

2. **Create a Webhook Endpoint on Stripe**: Log in to your Stripe dashboard and navigate to the Developers > Webhooks section. Click "Add endpoint" and specify the URL where your Django app will receive webhook events (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/stripe/`). Select the events you wish to receive notifications for.

3. **Implement the Webhook Receiver**: In your Django app, ensure the `webhooks.py` file is correctly set up to listen for POST requests at the endpoint you specified in Stripe. This file should authenticate the incoming requests using Stripe's signature verification method.

4. **Handle Events with StripeWH_Handler**: Customize the `StripeWH_Handler` class to define how your application should respond to each event. For instance, after a successful payment, you may want to create an order in your database and send a confirmation email to the user.

5. **Secure Your Endpoint**: Use Django's `@csrf_exempt` decorator to exempt your webhook view from CSRF verification, as the requests will be coming from Stripe's servers. However, ensure that you verify the requests' authenticity using the signature in the headers.

6. **Test Your Webhook**: Use Stripe's CLI or dashboard to send test webhook events to your endpoint. Ensure your handlers are correctly processing the events and that your application behaves as expected.

### Testing and Debugging

- **Stripe CLI**: Stripe offers a CLI tool that can forward webhook events to your local development server. This is invaluable for testing and debugging during development.

- **Logs and Errors**: Implement logging within your webhook handlers to capture any errors or unexpected behavior. This will aid in troubleshooting and ensuring that webhooks are processed correctly.

### Going Live

Before going live, double-check that you've updated your webhook endpoint to the production URL and selected the appropriate events on Stripe's dashboard. It's also recommended to review Stripe's best practices for securing webhooks.

---

## Monitoring Webhooks

After setting up your Stripe webhooks, you can monitor their performance directly from the Stripe dashboard. Below are screenshots that show where you can find information about webhook attempts and the status of your hosted endpoints.

### Webhook Attempts

Here you can see the list of attempts made to your webhook endpoints within the last 15 days. Each entry will show if the attempt was successful and provide details about the request.

![Webhook Attempts](/documentation/webhook%20attempt.png)

### Hosted Endpoints

This section of the Stripe dashboard provides an overview of your webhook endpoints, showing the error rate and status of each. It's essential to keep an eye on the error rate to ensure reliable operation.

![Hosted Endpoints](/documentation/webhook_endpoint.png)

### Reviewing Webhook Events

You should regularly review the events that Stripe sends to your webhook endpoints. Successful events indicate proper communication between Stripe and your application. If there are failed attempts, investigate the logs to determine the cause and implement necessary fixes.

## Transition from already-owning a webshop to Custom bulding Website for project 5: Utilizing Real Social Media Presence

In the development of this website, a strategic decision was made to leverage the existing digital footprint of Cosmos Watches, built over several years through our authentic presence on social media platforms. Unlike traditional approaches that may use mock-ups for educational or developmental purposes, this project directly integrates our real, active Facebook and Instagram pages. These platforms have not only been instrumental in building our brand's community but also in understanding our customers' preferences and feedback.

## Why Not Facebook and Instagram Mock-ups?

As the owner of Cosmos Watches, I've made a deliberate choice to integrate my actual Facebook and Instagram pages into this project, rather than relying on mock-ups. This decision is rooted in several key considerations:

- **Authenticity**: My social media pages are not just platforms for promotion; they are spaces where real interactions happen. They have been instrumental in shaping the brand's identity and forging genuine connections with my audience. By utilizing these real pages, the project reflects the authentic essence of Cosmos Watches.

- **Engagement**: Over the years, I've built a loyal community around my brand on these platforms. My followers don't just see my content; they engage with itâ€”through likes, comments, and shares. This level of interaction and engagement has been pivotal in my marketing strategy and is something that mock-ups could never replicate.

- **Brand History**: The Facebook and Instagram pages of Cosmos Watches are rich with history. They chronicle my journey, showcase my growth, and highlight my milestones. This historical depth adds a layer of context and meaning to the project that would be absent with the use of mock-ups.

- **Strategic Integration**: Incorporating my actual social media pages allows for a seamless integration of online identities. It ensures that the project is not an isolated endeavor but a continuation of my established digital presence. This strategic choice underscores the project's role in my broader digital marketing strategy, aligning with my goals of enhancing brand visibility and engagement.

### Emphasizing Real-World Applications

By choosing to utilize my genuine social media pages, I aim to provide a real-world application to my full stack development project. This approach not only showcases my technical skills but also my ability to think strategically about brand development and digital marketing. It's a reflection of my commitment to authenticity, engagement, and the continual evolution of Cosmos Watches in the digital realm.


## From Platform-Based to Personal Development: The Cosmos Watches Web Transition

The journey of Cosmos Watches' online presence has evolved significantly over the years, initially leveraging the convenience and simplicity offered by platforms such as Shopify and Wix. These platforms served as a launching pad, allowing us to quickly establish our online store and reach our customers with ease. However, the progression of my skills and the ambition to further personalize our brand's digital footprint led to a pivotal decision.

### The Decision for a Personal Touch

As I embarked on Project 5, a realization dawned upon me: the opportunity to blend my educational pursuits with my entrepreneurial spirit by developing the website myself. This project is not merely an academic requirement but a strategic step towards crafting a digital presence that is wholly reflective of Cosmos Watches' ethos and vision.

### Transitioning to a Self-Developed Website

This endeavor marks a significant shift from relying on external platforms to taking full control of our online presence. The aim is to develop a bespoke website that encapsulates the essence of Cosmos Watches, offering:

- **Enhanced functionality:** Implementing features and tools specifically tailored to our products and customers.
- **Improved user experience:** Creating a seamless, intuitive, and engaging online environment for our visitors.
- **Greater control over our digital presence:** Directly managing every aspect of the website, from design to content, aligning it closely with our brand's identity and goals.

### The Path Forward

This move towards a self-developed website represents a bold leap forward in our digital strategy, underpinned by a desire to more intimately connect with our customers and fully embody the Cosmos Watches brand online. As this project unfolds, it symbolizes not just a technical achievement, but a personal journey of growth, learning, and commitment to excellence.



This move to a custom-built website, developed with Django and Python, represents a significant step forward in our digital strategy. It allows us to more effectively integrate our social media content, offer a seamless shopping experience, and ultimately, provide a platform that grows with our business and meets the evolving needs of our customers.

### My Own Real Social Media Integration

Below are links to our official social media pages, which have been directly integrated into this project:

3. **Email Marketing:** Through email newsletters, we keep our subscribers informed about new collections, exclusive offers, and behind-the-scenes content. This direct line of communication helps in nurturing customer relationships and encouraging repeat business.

4. **SEO & SEM:** Search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM) tactics are employed to increase our online visibility and attract potential customers actively searching for space-themed watches or luxury timepieces. By targeting specific keywords and employing paid advertisements, we drive targeted traffic to our website.

5. **Influencer Collaborations:** Collaborating with influencers and thought leaders within the space exploration and luxury watch communities allows us to reach a broader audience. These partnerships help in authenticating our brand's presence and enhancing product visibility through social proof.

By integrating our e-commerce business model with these targeted marketing strategies, Cosmos Watches aims to not only sell products but also to create an immersive brand experience that resonates with our customers' passions and interests.

In developing this project, I focused on enhancing the website's Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to ensure better visibility and accessibility via search engines:

- **Robots.txt Implementation**: A `robots.txt` file was incorporated into the website's root directory. This file is crucial for SEO as it directs search engines on which parts of the site to avoid and which pages should not be indexed. By providing clear instructions, it optimizes the websiteâ€™s presence in search results, focusing on content that offers the most value.

- **Sitemap Creation**: To help search engines efficiently crawl and understand the website's structure, I created a detailed sitemap. This XML-formatted sitemap lists the website's key URLs, serving as a roadmap for search engines. The sitemap was generated using [www.XML-sitemaps.com](https://www.XML-sitemaps.com), ensuring an accurate and comprehensive guide to the site's layout.

These steps were key to improving the website's SEO, making it easier for search engines to index the site effectively and enhance its visibility to potential visitors.


### Future Directions

We are constantly exploring new technologies and marketing approaches to enhance our online presence and customer engagement. Augmented reality (AR) viewings, virtual try-ons, and interactive online events are among the innovations we are considering to offer an even more engaging and personalized shopping experience.
